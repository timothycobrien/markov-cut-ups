	I I saw the best minds of my mother I’m with you in Rockland where your condition has become serious and is everywhere about us! Visions! omens! hallucinations! miracles! ecstasies! gone down the American river! Dreams! adorations! illuminations! religions! the whole boatload of sensitive bullshit! Breakthroughs! over the river! They saw it all! the wild eyes! the holy yells! They bade farewell! They jumped off the bed, and continued along the floor and down the American river! Dreams! adorations! illuminations! religions! the whole boatload of sensitive bullshit! Breakthroughs! over the rooftops, storefront boroughs of teahead joyride neon blinking traffic light, sun and moon and tree vibrations in the subway window, jumped in the machinery of night, who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat up smoking in the closet, and even that imaginary, nothing but a hopeful little bit of hallucination— ah, Carl, while you are not safe I am not safe, and now you’re really in the yellow morning were stanzas of gibberish, who cooked rotten animals lung heart feet tail borsht & tortillas dreaming of the Bronx I’m with you in Rockland where you imitate the shade of my cottage in the neck and shrieked with delight
